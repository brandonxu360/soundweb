          <p className="about-description">
            SoundWeb is an interactive music visualization tool that helps you explore
            relationships between songs in a visually engaging way. Each song is represented as
             a node in a 3D space, with connections showing how songs relate to each other based 
             on various musical attributes.

             <br />

            We originally planned on creating a personalized track graph based on one's listening history
            on Spotify. However, due to unfortunate complications with the Spotify API, we decided
            to use a curated selection of songs for demonstration purposes.
